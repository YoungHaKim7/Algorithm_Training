# Types of CPU scheduling Algorithm

- There are mainly six types of process scheduling algorithms

  - ① First Come First Serve (FCFS)
    - Convoy effect
  - ② Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling
    - Avoiding Convoy Effect
  - ③ Shortest Remaining Time
  - ④ Priority Scheduling
  - ⑤ Round Robin Scheduling
  - ⑥ Multilevel Queue Scheduling

  - Every node is red or black
  - Root is always black
  - New insertions are always red
  - Every Paht form root - leaf ahs the same number of BLACK nodes
  - No path can have two consecutive RED nodes
  - Nulls are black
