# Types of CPU scheduling Algorithm

- There are mainly six types of process scheduling algorithms

  - ① First Come First Serve (FCFS)
    - Convoy effect
  - ② Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling
    - Avoiding Convoy Effect
  - ③ Shortest Remaining Time
  - ④ Priority Scheduling
  - ⑤ Round Robin Scheduling
  - ⑥ Multilevel Queue Scheduling
